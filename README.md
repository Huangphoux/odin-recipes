Hey, I'm currently following The Odin Project curriculum,
and this is a project to demonstrate my HTML foundation.

I'm doing this on my dual-boot laptop, in Ubuntu 22.04.

Hopefully I can finish this in the-day-I'm-currently-writing-this' evening.

20-54 2024/09/11: Hey there, you can access this repo at [Odin Recipes](https://huangphoux.github.io/odin-recipes/). Didn't know you can have multiple Github Pages. I guess I'm done with this for now.
